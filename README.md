# Email Spam Detector Using Python and Machine Learning
This repository contains the internship task I did for my Data Science Internship at MindShift Technologies. This project focuses on building an Email Spam Detector that classifies emails as Spam or Ham (Non-Spam) using Python and Machine Learning techniques. The project uses TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction and Logistic Regression for classification.
## Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
Load the dataset using Pandas.
Map spam to 1 and ham to 0 for the target column.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
2. Feature Extraction:
Use TF-IDF Vectorization to convert email text into numerical features.
3. Model Building:
Train a Logistic Regression model on the processed data.
4. Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's accuracy on training and testing datasets.
Real-World Testing:
Predict whether a sample email is spam or ham using the trained model.

## Features
1. Classifies emails as Spam or Ham (Non-Spam).
2. Utilizes TF-IDF to convert email text into numerical features.
3. Implements Logistic Regression for accurate and efficient classification.
4. Evaluates model performance using accuracy score metrics.
5. Includes real-world testing with sample email inputs.
